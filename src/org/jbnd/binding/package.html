Binding classes that connect the data providing classes (org.jbnd.data) and UI elements 
(which are the final consumers of the data). The Binding interface defines what that
connection is programatically. The Bound interface should be implemented by UI and
UI control classes to connect to Binding implementations and present the data found
in them.

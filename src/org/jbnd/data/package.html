Classes that store DataObjects and provide them (in a list-like form) to
the Binding classes (found in the org.jbnd.binding package). All the classes
in this package implement the DataSource interface. Their most relevant function
is that they ensure that org.jbnd.event.DataSourceEvents are fired
whenever a DataSource's contents change (also when DataObjects provided by it change).

Classes that support the JBND library; some of them are essential
to the library, some are not. The classes
that the programmer at some point might need to interact with
directly are:
<ul>
	<li>Filter and AbstractFilter - used with org.jbnd.data.FilteringProxyDataSource</li>
	<li>NamingSupport - for deriving user presentable labels and such from key(path)s</li>
	<li>Utilities - for various common operations</li>
	<li>ValidationExceptionSupport - for translating org.jbnd.ValidationExceptions into user feedback</li>
	</ul>

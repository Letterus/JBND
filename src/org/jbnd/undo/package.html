<body>

Undo/redo support built into JBND. Provides generic support for undoing/redoing changes
made to DataObjects, and is easily extendible to support undoability of other operations
in your app. <b>Note: classes in this package are mostly not thread-safe.</b>
<p>
Architecturally similar to Swing's undo support (javax.swing.undo.*), but without any
dependencies on other parts of Swing.
